Settings and help Upgrade Conversation with Gemini It's about coding  

That's great! Coding is a fantastic and versatile skill. To help you with what you need, I need a little more information.
Are you looking for:
A specific code snippet or solution? Tell me what you're trying to do.
Help understanding a concept? Let me know what you're stuck on (e.g., loops, data structures, algorithms).
Information about a programming language? Which one are you interested in? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Resources for learning to code? I can recommend websites, tutorials, or courses.
Once you provide more detail, I can give you a helpful and specific answer.
 1. Create an empty list called my-list 
 2. Append the following elements to my-list:10, 20,30, 40. 
 3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list. 
 4. Extend my-list with another list:[50, 60, 70]. 
 5. Remove the last element from my-list. 
 6. Sort my-list in ascending order. 
 7. Find the print the index of the value 30 in my-list  


Python# 1. Create an empty list called my_list
my_list = []

# 2. Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40
my_list.append(10)
my_list.append(20)
my_list.append(30)
my_list.append(40)
# Alternatively, you can use a loop or the extend method to add multiple elements.
# my_list.extend([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(f"After appending: {my_list}")

# 3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list (index 1)
my_list.insert(1, 15)
print(f"After inserting 15 at index 1: {my_list}")

# 4. Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70]
my_list.extend([50, 60, 70])
print(f"After extending with [50, 60, 70]: {my_list}")

# 5. Remove the last element from my_list
my_list.pop()
# Alternatively, you can use del my_list[-1]
print(f"After removing the last element: {my_list}")

# 6. Sort my_list in ascending order
my_list.sort()
print(f"After sorting: {my_list}")

# 7. Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list
index_of_30 = my_list.index(30)
print(f"The index of the value 30 is: {index_of_30}")
