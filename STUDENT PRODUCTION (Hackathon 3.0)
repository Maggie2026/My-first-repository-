       SOLUTIONS 


> “Our problem is clear: students have talent but lack a platform to showcase it.
Our solution is Students Production, a web + mobile app with features like project showcasing, collaboration, a marketplace, gamification, and mentor support.
The impact? Students don’t just study — they create, get recognized, and even monetize their talent.
We’ll build this with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and cloud storage.
In short: we’re turning students from consumers into creators.”
