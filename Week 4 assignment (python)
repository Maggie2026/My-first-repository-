1. Reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.


2. Handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.



def main():
    # Ask the user for the input file name
    filename = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")

    try:
        # Try opening and reading the file
        with open(filename, "r") as infile:
            content = infile.read()

        # Modify the content (example: convert to uppercase)
        modified_content = content.upper()

        # Create a new file to save the modified content
        new_filename = "modified_" + filename
        with open(new_filename, "w") as outfile:
            outfile.write(modified_content)

        print(f"File processed successfully! Modified version saved as '{new_filename}'.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: You don't have permission to read this file.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

 Explanation:

with open(filename, "r") → Reads the file safely.

content.upper() → Example modification (you can change this to anything, like reversing text, adding line numbers, etc.).

"modified_" + filename → The new file is saved with a modified name.

try/except → Handles cases like file not found, no permission, or other errors.
